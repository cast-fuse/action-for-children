# Action for Children

A prototype for enabling relationships between parents and support workers

### Why?

Action for children runs support groups where parents meet with family support workers so they can talk to them about any questions they have about their child's wellbeing. The family support workers can then build a relationship with the parent to help spot any problems earlier and better support the parent.

With the power of realtime communication via the internet this prototype hopes to discover if this service is viable online.

### How?

The prototype will be a web app that uses the [intercom messaging widget](https://www.intercom.com/) to allow a parent to talk directly to family support worker. The widget has a text chat interface with a list of recent conversations plus options to be contacted by email or to request a callback via phone later if the family support worker is not online at the time.
